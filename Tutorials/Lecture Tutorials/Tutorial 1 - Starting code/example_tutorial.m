%perform cell extraction
clear;
load('example.mat'); %contains a movie M, ground truth cell maps (S_ground) and traces (T_ground)
config = [];
config = extract.get_defaults(config); %calls the defaults

% Essentials, without these EXTRACT will give an error:
config.avg_cell_radius = 7; %Average cell radius is 7.

%Optionals, but strongly advised to handpick:
%Movie is small enough that EXTRACT will not automatically partition this,
%but still a good idea to keep these in sight!
config.trace_output_option = 'raw'; % Choose 'nonneg' for non - negative Ca2 + traces, 'raw' for raw ones !
config.num_partitions_x = 1;
config.num_partitions_y = 1;
config.cellfind_filter_type = 'none'; % The movie is clean enough, no need for lowpass filtering
config.verbose = 2; %Keeping verbose=2 gives insight into the EXTRACTion process, always advised to keep 2
config.spatial_highpass_cutoff = inf; % no need for highpass filtering
config.remove_background = 0; %no need for background removal

% Optionals whose defaults exist:
config.use_gpu = 0; % This is a small dataset, will be fast on cpu anyways.
config.max_iter = 10; % 10 is a good number for this dataset
config.adaptive_kappa = 1; % Adaptive kappa is on for this movie. For an actual movie, keeping it off
% may be beneficial depending on the noise levels.
config.cellfind_min_snr = 0.5; % Default snr is 1, lower this (never less than 0) to increase cell count at the expense of more spurious cells!
config.thresholds.T_min_snr = 5;

config.visualize_cellfinding = 1;

% Perform EXTRACTion:
output = extract.solvers.extractor(M, config);

%% Matching ground truth to EXTRACTed signals
[h, w, k] = size(full(output.spatial_weights));
S_ex = reshape(full(output.spatial_weights), h * w, k);
idx_match = extract.internal.match_sets(S_ex, S_ground); %this is a very useful helper function, use this as you need!

T_ex = output.temporal_weights';
%% Perform multivariate linear regression for comparison
M_res = reshape(M, 2500, 2000);
X = mean(M_res, 2);
M_res = (M_res - X) ./ X; %perform dfof
S = S_ex;
T_est = (S' * S)^(-1) * S' * M_res;
% Since this movie does not contain unfound cells or neuropils, this will
% be close to ground truth and EXTRACT outputs!
