function [traces,filters]=final_robust_run(M,output_in,choices)
	
	% This function runs a final robust regression on the movie via the sorted cell filters. Note that this function is not optimized for memory consumption,
	% so if you need to process in chunks, please run an outside for loop and chunk the movie only across time axis, no partitioning in space is allowed!

	% Inputs: M is the movie, output_in is the EXTRACT output from the last run of EXTRACT and choices is an array of 1s and 0s denoting cell
	% sorting output. Note that output_in should not be changed during cell-sorting, only choices array is created!

	config=output_in.config;

	% do not change the partition number here, otherwise it will lead to duplicate cells!
	config.num_partitions_x=1;
	config.num_partitions_y=1;

	config.max_iter=0;
